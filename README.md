This is a project completed in November 2023 for fun that implements basic machine learning projects. It is pretty rudimentary now but I will try to add to and improve it when I have time.

Attempts were made to allow custom layer sizes of Dense NNs using linked lists and cell arrays.

The code (file) structure referenced Dr.Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course.
